# PoseNet with p5.js

This project demonstrates human pose estimation in the browser using [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). The app uses your webcam to detect and draw skeleton keypoints over your body in real-time.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time pose detection using TensorFlow.js PoseNet model
- Smooth rendering using p5.js canvas
- Works directly in the browser (no backend needed)
- Supports detecting multiple keypoints (e.g. nose, eyes, arms, legs)
- Lightweight and easy to customize

## 🚀 Getting Started
